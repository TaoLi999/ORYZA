User agreement of ORYZA

The ecophysiological rice model, ORYZA, embodies our best understanding to date of the biogeochemistry of crop growth, and cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water in crop field ecosystem.  The primary purpose of the model is to provide a tool for rice ecosystem analysis, test the consistency of data, evaluate the effects of changes in management and climate on rice production, and optimize rice field management. 

Evolution of the model will continue with an improved understanding of biogeochemical and plant physiological processes, and other management aspects. The identification of weak areas which the model is yet to quantify adequately is the key to further model development. Ideally, a model application on different cases will lead to the identification of needed research and experimentation.

We value the experiences and comments of our collaborators in using ORYZA and encourage their feedbacks on the current model, as well as insights and suggestions for future model improvement. It would be particularly helpful if users would communicate such feedback, formally or informally, and if possible, share with us documented model applications including manuscripts, papers, procedures, or individual model development.
